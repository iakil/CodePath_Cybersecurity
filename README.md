# Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity is a course for students interested in understanding the role of security professionals through interactive hands-on practice, reading, and lectures. With a focus on web applications security, students will learn to think like a hacker and exploit vulnerabilities, while also exploring how to build offensive capabilities into applications. Students will gain broad foundational knowledge of cybersecurity concepts while also applying these concepts with fun simulations replicating real-world cyber threats.

This course was originally developed in collaboration with Meta.

### Time Commitment

- **Schedule:**
  - Starts on the week of September 6, 2022
    - Remote (Section 1): Tuesdays at 6:00 PM - 8:00 PM PT
    - Remote (Section 2): Saturdays at 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM PT
  - Duration: 10 weeks
- **Live session attendance required**
- **Outside of class time:** Student's should plan to spend 5 hours outside of class working on weekly assignments

### Attendance and Coursework Submissions

CodePath courses focus on developing student's habits and skills in order to to be successful in the tech industry. Success in industry goes beyond proficiency in technical domains; the ability to be punctual, meet project deadlines and work effectively in a collaborative team are equally important skills. The following policies around attendance and coursework submissions are meant to encourage professional behavior.

#### Attendance

- **Allowable absences:**
  - **Non-credit sites:** Max of 3 sessions, no questions asked.
    - Submission of that unit's coursework by the deadline is still mandatory.
    - You are expected to actively attend and participate in each session. We check attendance multiple times throughout a class session and may mark you as absent if you are missing for the majority of a session.
    - If you have an extenuating circumstance regarding attendance, email support@codepath.org as soon as possible.
  - **For-credit sites:** Please check with your professor and/or campus policies.

#### Additional Grade Incentives

- **For Non-credit sites:**
  - **Perfect Attendance:** Attendance of ALL sessions will result in the addition of 10% points to the final grade. (i.e. a 70% would become an 80% and an 85% would become a 95%).
  - **Consistent Attendance:** Attendance of at least 1 session for every week **OR** 70% for all of the sessions in the course will result in the addition of 5% points to the final grade. (i.e. a 70% would become a 75% and an 85% would become a 90%).

- **For For-credit sites:**
  - Students receive an additional bonus on their grade if they complete all their assignments:
    - **+5%** bonus for all complete submissions (meaning they submitted something for all assignments or labs or group milestones, but incurred at least 1 late submission)
    - **+10%** bonus for no late/missing/incomplete submissions

#### Attendance Incentives

- **Perfect Attendance:** Attendance of ALL sessions will result in the addition of 10% points to the final grade (i.e. a 70% would become an 80% and an 85% would become a 95%).
- **Consistent Attendance:** Attendance of at least 1 session for every week **OR** 70% for all of the sessions in the course will result in the addition of 5% points to the final grade (i.e. a 70% would become a 75% and an 85% would become a 90%).
  
#### Coursework Submissions


  
### Coursework Weighting

All coursework grading and accountability is handled by CodePath. The following table outlines how each coursework section is weighted in calculating a student's final grade.

| Weight | Section                | Description                                                 |
|:-------|:-----------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------|
| 20%    | Security Shepherd Labs | [Security Shepherd Platform](https://security.codepath.com) |
| 25%    | Weekly CTF Assignments | [Weekly CTF Platform](https://ctf.codepath.com)             |
| 35%    | Project Assignments    | Written Pen Testing Assignments                              |
| 20%    | Capstone Final         | [Capstone CTF Platform](https://capstone.codepath.com)      |

**All coursework items** are submitted through CodePath Course Portal and due by their posted deadlines.
